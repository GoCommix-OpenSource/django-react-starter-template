**djReact** is a tool for quickly creating Django projects with integrated React frontend.

## Installation

You can install **djReact** directly from its GitHub repository using pip:

```bash
pip install djReact
# or direct from github
pip install git+https://github.com/MixoMate-OpenSource/djReact
```
## Usage
After installing `djReact`, you can use the `djReact` command to create a new Django project with integrated React frontend. Simply run the following command:
```bash
djReact mywebsite
```
Replace `mywebsite` with the desired name for your Django project.

## Features
- Seamless integration of Django and React.
- Automated setup of Django project structure.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## After Generating project
There are two different ways for using djReact, explained below:

__1. Run Backend and Frontend Separately__: In this approach, you run the backend (Django) server and the frontend (React) development server as two separate processes. You develop and test the frontend and backend independently, and they communicate through HTTP requests.

  - Backend (Django):
    - Navigate to Django project directory.
    - Run Django server: `python manage.py runserver`.
  - Frontend (React):
    - Navigate to React project directory.
    - Run React server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
  - Interaction: Frontend makes HTTP requests to backend API endpoints.

__2. Serve React Build with Django:__ In this approach, you build your React application and serve the static files generated by the React build process using Django without loosing `spa` property. Django serves both the backend API endpoints and the frontend React application. Users access your application through Django's server, and Django handles routing requests to the appropriate endpoints or static files.

  - Build React App:
    - Navigate to React project directory.
    - Build React app: `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
  - Run server (Django+React):
    - Navigate to Django project directory.
    - Run Django server: `python manage.py runserver`.
  - Interaction: Your app is running `http://localhost:8000` and seamlessly serving react build out of the box.
